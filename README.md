## Quesion

Create a new react application for solving the following task:
Remove all equal consecutive elements and leave only the first occurrence of the element.
examples of input/output:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 2]
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2] -> [1, 2, 1, 2]

Create a UI for entering the array values with the ability for editing them.
When the user runs the algorithm save the input and add it to a history, the user should be able to select previously entered inputs from the history.

Send a git repo or archive with the solution (if you send an archive include the .git folder).
